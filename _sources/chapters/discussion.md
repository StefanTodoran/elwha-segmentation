# Dataset Realignment Discussion

## Problem Description

The purpose of this project is to prepare RGB and IR images taken of the Elwha river in 2012 for more advanced CV processing like cold water refuge mapping. The dataset is made up of photos taken by an IR camera and an RGB camera. As such, the RGB images and IR images do not align. There is an additional quirk adding complexity: the RGB images overlap amongst themselves, as do the IR images. For more information, see the book introduction.

## Approach Utilized

The reconstruction of the dataset begins by stitching together RGB images via feature detection, like a panorama. In this specific case, the images are labelled 1 through 406, and it turned out that IR image `x` overlaps with RGB images `x` and `x-1`.

Then, the next step was to estimate the homography for projecting each IR image onto its RGB stitch image. This homography is used to project a mask of the same dimensions as the IR image onto a background of the same dimensions as the RGB stitch. This mask is then composited over the RGB stitch and used to crop it, after which the final step is to use the reverse of the previously estimated homography to project the cropped RGB stitch back to rectangular form (of the same dimensions as the IR image)!

The homography estimation function provided by openCV can run RANSAC, however this proved not to be enough to deal with outliers. Luckily, we know information about the dataset that can help filter out outlier matches before we pass them to our homography estimator!

Generally, the IR image should align with the stitched RGB images very well with just a little distortion, as the misalignment factor is low enough such that even simply pasting it on top gets it close to aligned. Therefore, we can assign ever keypoint to a quadrant relative to the center of the image. If a keypoint and its matched keypoint are in different quadrants (in their respective images) then they are likely an outlier, and we can discard that match.

## Problems Encountered

The realignment of this dataset was no easy task, an many problems were encountered along the way. It could also without a doubt stand to be improved and simplied. Some silly issues included only used the first 50 matches (the homographies were greatly improved by using all matches), or a bug in the difference deviation filtering causing only matches with similar x and y in both images to not be thrown out. 

However, all that aside, a couple of problems stand out:

* RANSAC is simply not enough to generate good homographies
* It is difficult to identify when a homography is poor

Neither of this problems were fully solved in this book, however a great deal of work went into creating workable methods of addressing these problems. The key difficulty is that the second issue of quality assessment needs to be solved first, because having that baseline is the most scientific way of judging progress on the first. The technique settled on was to find a baseline homography by running the matching workflow, and then to compare all matches with this one on future runs. Specifically, the decompositions of the homographies into rotation, translation and normal matrices were compared.

As for the issue of RANSAC not being enough to sift through the noise and bad keypoint matches, the match filtering approach had two parts. The first, described breifly above I called `cross quadrant filtering`, which is the simpler of the two filtering methods and by far the more effective one. Keypoints whose corresponding matched keypoint lie in different quadrants of their respective images are thrown out, with the exception of keypoints very near the image center are these are liable to cross quadrants even if they are a true match.

The second pass of filtering checks the deviation in `x` and `y` of matches. While the numeric value of the difference between a keypoints `x` or `y` value and the `x` or `y` value of its matched keypoint is completely arbitrary, one will notice that true matches tend to form parallel lines in our visualization. This is because their `dx` and `dy` values should be similar relative to each other, as any good projection will leave the IR image mostly flat with minor distortion. Therefore matches whose `dx` and `dy` accross images deviates too far from the median can be thrown out. 

## Alternative Approaches

The vast majority of existing approaches in matching cross-modal images seem to rely on neural networks and other computationally intensive techniques that require large datasets. These approaches come at the tradeoff of being harder to train and being less suitable for smaller datasets, but likely have the benefit of lower (or no) dataset loss, if trained properly.

Another approach that was in fact originally part of the plan for this book is to skip the homography all together and to just paste the IR images onto the RGB stitches directly, using keypoints for some minor resizing and to estimate where to paste. For this specific dataset the technique resulted in worse quality reconstructions particularly in the first 1/4 of the dataset, when the plane is turning, but the pros of the solution are that it is vastly simpler and less succeptible to homography projection issues.

## Next Steps

There are two main tasks that remain for this project. The first, as spelled out in the introduction, is to make use of this aligned dataset for further processing, such as the cold water refuge mapping it was originally intended for.

The second area of work is in improving the dataset realignment process. There may be further ways to improve the matching of images, which would lead to both lower dataset loss and better quality reconstructions.
