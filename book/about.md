### Try it Yourself

The dataset of images from the elwha river basin is quite large, so it is not included in the repository. If you'd like to try the workflow yourself, you will need to download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkr9712m8jt3zft/AirborneData.mat?dl=0).

<!-- TODO, fix the dropbox link -->
